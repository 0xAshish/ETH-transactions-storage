Create a table in Postgres:

	psql -f create_table.sql <yourDB>

Run the script.

	python3.6 you/path/to/script/ethsync.py <yourDB>

Or use ethstorage.service to run as a deamon. Change string 

	ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3.6 you/path/to/script/ethsync.py <yourDB>

Put the file to	/lib/systemd/system. Then
